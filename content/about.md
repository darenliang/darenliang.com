Hi there!

My name is Daren Liang. I have graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and
am now working in NYC as a software engineer at [Citi](https://www.citigroup.com).

I enjoy working on [Imglabs.io](https://www.imglabs.io/) and other [programming projects](/projects) in my free time. You can find me on
GitHub [@darenliang](https://github.com/darenliang "darenliang's GitHub").

Additionally, I like exploring the beauty of mathematics and probability. Feel free to email me any interesting problems
at [daren@darenliang.com](mailto:daren@darenliang.com). I'll take a shot at them!
