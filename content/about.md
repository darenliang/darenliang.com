Hi there!

My name is Daren Liang. I am currently an undergraduate computer science
student at the University of Toronto.

I enjoy working on small programming projects on my free time. You can find me on
GitHub [@darenliang](https://github.com/darenliang "darenliang's GitHub").

I also enjoy exploring the beauty of mathematics and statistics. Feel free to email me any interesting problems
at [daren@darenliang.com](mailto:daren@darenliang.com). I'll take a shot at them!
