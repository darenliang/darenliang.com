Hi there!

I am Daren Liang, a graduate of the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/about-u-of-t) and currently a software engineer in risk management at [Citi](https://www.citigroup.com) based in NYC.

In my free time, I work on [Imglabs.io](https://www.imglabs.io/), a cloud-based image proxy service, and other [programming projects](/projects). You can find me on
GitHub [@darenliang](https://github.com/darenliang "darenliang's GitHub").

Additionally, I like exploring the beauty of mathematics and probability. Feel free to email me any interesting problems
at [daren@darenliang.com](mailto:daren@darenliang.com). I'll take a shot at them!
